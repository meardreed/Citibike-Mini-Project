<br>
<br>For this challenge, we used November and December 2022 data to observe trends pertaining to end-of-year festivities and how they impact the Citi Bike program.

<br>The different questions that were asked are:
<br>+How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
<br>+What are the top/bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? During the Holidays(Thanksgiving,Christmas)
<br>+What are the top/bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? During the Holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas)
<br>+What is the number of rides during Thanksgiving and Christmas by members or casual riders?


**Analysis**

Grove St Path and Hoboken Terminal came on top for start and end stations for the month of November and December 2022. We believe their proximity to train stations makes them the preferred pick-up or drop-off stations for commuters. Over 6000 riders pick up or drop off bikes at each location.

November peak day is on the 12th with 3779 riders, the lowest activities are displayed on Thanksgiving day, 24th, and the 27th with numbers as low as 1160 and 1075 respectively.

December peak day is on the 8th with 2568 riders, the lowest activities are displayed on Christmas Eve and Christmas day, 24th, and the 25th with numbers as low as 345 and 245 respectively.

It is also observed that members are more likely to ride versus non members.

Busiest stations for both Holidays remain little changed, adding Bergen Ave as another preferred stations by riders. Also close to a subway station.
